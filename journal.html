<p><span id="text">I think coding has been pretty fine so far. I do think the structure of Html and Css can be a bit confusing and hard to get used to though. I have learned divs, ids, a bit of styling, and making text interesting.<br> <span id="example">Like this!<br></span> I also used a bit of information I did from 7th grade when Molly taught us on Zoom. I am a bit discouraged because I have not yet started on my homepage, since I do not really know how to start. I want it to involve layering lots of images in the correct places and adding transitions, but I have not learned how to do it yet so I am a bit bummed. I hope what I want to do is possible. Overall, I am still inexperienced and have not tried out any image/div positioning on my website. Despite this, I'm sure it will look great when I am done with it! </span></p>

<p><span id="text">So far, I am facing <span id="alot">A LOT</span> of hurdles in the construction of my website. Lots of the things I am trying to do are very hard due to my limited knowledge. In addition, I want to incorporate lots of images in my website, and it is very hard due to the nature of positioning in html/css. However, I do think with time and consistency, I will be able to acheive some of the things I want to do, so I will keep trying! Some of the things I learned was transforming a div with a background image to get bigger and smaller, which turned out to be really cool and useful. I was able to make my moon and mountains do these transitions on my index website. Some things I am unsure of are whether I should add a menu bar in the index website and about the layout of my journal website.</p>
