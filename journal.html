<p><span id="text">I think coding has been pretty fine so far. I do think the structure of Html and Css can be a bit confusing and hard to get used to though. I have learned divs, ids, a bit of styling, and making text interesting.<br> <span id="example">Like this!<br></span> I also used a bit of information I did from 7th grade when Molly taught us on Zoom. I am a bit discouraged because I have not yet started on my homepage, since I do not really know how to start. I want it to involve layering lots of images in the correct places and adding transitions, but I have not learned how to do it yet so I am a bit bummed. I hope what I want to do is possible. I'm sure it will look great when I am done with it!</span></p>
