<p><span id="text">I have just finished my arrays project! I did struggle a bit with styling through javascript. I used lots of prewritten code so it was a bit unfamiliar at first, but it was satisfying when I understood. Overall, it works okay, but I was unable to fix the heart shape background shape. My christmas card+other things link is c26lr1.github.io/christmascard.html</span></p>

<p><span id="text">My winter break is going pretty well. I have been able to work on my holiday card for my grandmother very much. I am almost done completing it. Here is a short explanation of the things it does:
 In the Christmas section, santa and 3 presents appear and disappear when you click on the christmas tree.When you click on Santa, some christmas music will start playing. You can pause it by clicking santa again. However, I plan to record me playing simple christmas songs on the violin and make it so that a random song from an array of maybe 5 starts playing. I think she will enjoy it more since it is more heartfelt that way. The presents will link to the sections underneath it for smooth transition. The next section is a New Year section, with me typing "Happy New year" at the top and "This year included.." at the bottom. The arrows in this section link to the section underneath it. The image of mount Fuji creates a celebratory mood, and if you click it, the image changes to one of a rabbit, since 2023 is the year of the rabbit in Japanese culture. You can turn the image back to Mt. Fuji by clicking on it again. The birthday section was a bit complicated. On a regular laptop, you can spawn random-patterned balloons by clicking. However, the coordinates of the click and the actual location on the section was really weird, so it ended up being very reliable (you can still try it though). On a mobile device, I put 6 divs in precise spots and just made the patterns of those balloon divs change everytime the user clicked. This method was more reliable, but the screen was small so it ended up looking a little less smooth than what I wanted. Finally, the last section is going to be a picture recap of the things I did last summer when I went to Japan to visit my grandmother, and the images are going to randomly change when she clicks a button. I hope she enjoys! </span></p>
