<h3><stong>Oct 2nd 2022</stong></h3>
<p><span id="text">I think coding has been pretty fine so far. I do think the structure of Html and Css can be a bit confusing and hard to get used to though. I have learned divs, ids, a bit of styling, and making text interesting.<br> <span id="example">Like this!<br></span> I also used a bit of information I did from 7th grade when Molly taught us on Zoom. I am a bit discouraged because I have not yet started on my homepage, since I do not really know how to start. I want it to involve layering lots of images in the correct places and adding transitions, but I have not learned how to do it yet so I am a bit bummed. I hope what I want to do is possible. Overall, I am still inexperienced and have not tried out any image/div positioning on my website. Despite this, I'm sure it will look great when I am done with it! </span></p>

<p><span id="text">So far, I am facing <span id="alot">A LOT</span> of hurdles in the construction of my website. Lots of the things I am trying to do are very hard due to my limited knowledge. In addition, I want to incorporate lots of images in my website, and it is very hard due to the nature of positioning in html/css. However, I do think with time and consistency, I will be able to acheive some of the things I want to do, so I will keep trying! Some of the things I learned was transforming a div with a background image to get bigger and smaller, which turned out to be really cool and useful. I was able to make my moon and mountains do these transitions on my index website. Some things I am unsure of are whether I should add a menu bar in the index website and about the layout of my journal website.</span></p>
<h3><stong>Oct 16th 2022</stong></h3>
<p><span id="text">Right now, I am working on an Animation Project. I am trying to do something including audio and music, but I am finding it to be pretty challenging. The main part where I am stuck on is the syncing of the visual animation using keyframes and the audio file I want to play while the animation is occuring. One idea I have to acheive this is to include seconds before the acutal animation telling the user when to push the play button on the audio, since I don't know how to start is manually. I also want to make a red line that goes through the music staff synced with the music I am playing. Finally, I want to put dots on the keyboard image in sync with the notes being played, but this may be really difficult due to the tempo of the song and the calculation of which percent each dot should be at during the keyframes animation. I will make a Lab and figure it out! Hope it works out! </span></p>
<h3><stong>Oct 27th 2022</stong></h3>
<p><span id="text">My Animation Project of Fly me to the Moon has been going pretty well overall. I have learned a lot about keyframes and syncing it with multiple moving divs! Molly also recently helped me make my projects page a lot better. I want to find a good quality, continuous background image though, something I do not have yet. I also recently had an idea to completely change my Journal Page. I want to change the background image of it to something more homey--and I an idea to try to make the different journal months clickable objects. The users will know which objects to click by hovering over lots of them and see which one makes a sound effect. For example, when the user hover overs the furnace in the background image, a crackling fire sound might play. However, I will probably need more knowledge on javascript to fully acheive this. I will also probably need to add lots of event listeners. Most importantly though, I am just really excited to start doing this... maybe over the weekend when I have more time. Hopefully it turns out as cool as I am imagining it to! </span></p>
