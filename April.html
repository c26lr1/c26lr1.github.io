<p><span id="text">My Circle Codesketch tackles the making of all the different circles and the way they vary size. One thing to note is that I made their position relative so that all the different circles wouldn't be stacked on top of each other, but I imagine the actual code would require for the positioning to be absolute and revolving around the cursor. My codesketch used a function that made divs and appended them to the body. There were 4 premade classes that would vary the size of the circles. In the function, I would get a random number from 1 to 4 and use it to decide which class the div was assigned to, thus deciding its size. I would then run this function a bunch of times to make a random number of circles all varying between 4 sizes.  </span></p>
