<h1><span id="Title"><center><strong>NOVEMBER</strong></center></span></h1>
<h3><stong>Nov 1st 2022</stong></h3>
<p><span id="text">Today I was able to work on my new Journal page--one that matches my previous aesthetic better. I have momentarily put my animation project on hold and have been designing stuff on my new Journal Page, like gifs. I want to find a way to use javascript to play audio when the user hovers over somthing, along with the giff that plays. I want to use different objects in the background pictures and add diffferent sound effects! Since I will use different objects for each months, and there are a lot of months, I think I might also make a key listing all the objects and the months they correspond to. On an unrelated note, today is the first day of November!!! I did not go trick or treating yesterday but I got to see my dad in a ridiculous wig so I guess that was fun. </span></p>
<h3><stong>Nov 4th 2022</stong></h3>
<p><span id="text">I just finished my Codesketch Journal after a long time of working on it!!! I did not know that many javascript commands so I had to look some stuff up. I also found Tara's instructions on Thursday and her Website helpful, since it had similar code. Now, I feel like I understand Java a little more, and I find it more fun. I will probably also finish the first project, the Animation Project, over this weekend. Additionally, there are some weird things happening with my Journal page, especially with the links.
Here are the defintions: 
A varaiable is like a shoebox, can you can label it or assign different things to it.
A function is like a mini machine. You can put stuff in it (input) and get an unique result (output). You can give functions name and make your own to customize what the 'machine' actually does. A number  in code is an integer, and is viewed by the computer as a value rather than a character. A string is kind of the opposite. A string is just a list of characters and letters that the computer can store. It can't do anything special with it though, like taking the string "five" and somehow knowing that its value is 5.<br> <br>My Codesketch Project has a Day vs Night image you can click on. The website uses javascript functions so that your clicks can spawn different images. You can only spawn a boat in the water, a camel on the sand dunes, birds in the sunny sky, and storm clouds in the night sky. Hopefully it is very fun for my users!</span></p>

<p><span id="text">An event listener is a pre-made javascript function. It is for the computer to listen for something that the user does. An event is what is listens for and all the data is gathers from what the user does. You can make it show up in the console by console.log ing it. the periods used in functions allow you to go into the thing the function takes place. If you console.log the event or whatever you name it, it shows you all the stuff I described above.</span></p>

<p><span id="text">My Project uses lots of javascript to show some cool stuff with the violin. I have been playing violin since 7th grade and although it can be frusturating at times, it feels very rewarding. If you click the word "violin", a div of a violin shows up, and disappears if you click the word again. However, when you first click the word, a cute violin gif and some words of advice show up. These do not disappear. If you click the image of the violin while it is visible, it shows a picture of a violin bow where you clicked. this picture also moves with your clicks. Here, the user is supposed to see the words of advice and click to move the bow in between the fingerboard and bridge. Once they do, an audio of a violin chord will play. This audio is pretty short so it can be repeatedly played. I left my violin at school today so I had to use an online website to record it. A real violin sounds different. I am still proud of what I was able to get done though.</span></p>

<p><span id="text">I have just finished my christmas card to my grandmother. I tried to style it the best I could using @media to change positioning for mobile devices. I plan to extend the card to more things, so seeing if my positioning worked on my phone is important and will tell me if I can keep going~~~I found some really weird interactions with the vh and vw units. I am unsure whether I am using it right.</span></p>
<h3><stong>Nov 30th 2022</stong></h3>
<p><span id="text">I just finished my square quilt project! This project taught me a lot about Javascript and the cool things you can do with for loops. It did get a little complicated in some parts though. I also learned how to use "i" in a loop for useful things like making lots of divs and giving them each a unique id or color. I made it so that the user can create color gradients of green, red, blue, teal, purple, yellow, and orange. It was very fun!</span></p>
