<h3><stong>Nov 1st 2022</stong></h3>
<p><span id="text">Today I was able to work on my new Journal page--one that matches my previous aesthetic better. I have momentarily put my animation project on hold and have been designing stuff on my new Journal Page, like gifs. I want to find a way to use javascript to play audio when the user hovers over somthing, along with the giff that plays. I want to use different objects in the background pictures and add diffferent sound effects! Since I will use different objects for each months, and there are a lot of months, I think I might also make a key listing all the objects and the months they correspond to. On an unrelated note, today is the first day of November!!! I did not go trick or treating yesterday but I got to see my dad in a ridiculous wig so I guess that was fun. </span></p>
